This VBA macro generates a new worksheet called "Revenue Report" by filtering data from an existing worksheet called "Master". The filtering is based on the dates in column G, which must be in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", and the date range used is for the previous month.

The macro then copies the filtered data from columns A to G and K to P into the new worksheet, along with the column headings. Finally, the macro autofits the columns in the new worksheet and selects the new worksheet.

**The steps to add the Developer ribbon in Excel:**

* Open Excel and click on the File tab in the top left corner.

* Click on Options in the left menu to open the Excel Options dialog box.

* Click on Customize Ribbon in the left menu.

* In the right pane, under the Customize the Ribbon section, check the box next to Developer.

* Click on OK to save the changes and close the Excel Options dialog box.

* The Developer ribbon should now be visible in the Excel ribbon at the top of the screen.

Note: If you cannot see the Developer tab after following the above steps, it may be because it is hidden. You can try unhiding it by going to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > Customize the Ribbon section > Reset > Reset all customizations. This will reset the ribbon to its default settings, which should include the Developer tab.

**How to Use**

* Open the workbook that contains the worksheet named "Master".
* Press ALT + F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.
* In the Editor, go to Insert > Module.
* Copy and paste the macro code into the new module.
* Close the Editor and go back to the worksheet.
* Click on the Developer tab in the Excel ribbon.

* Click on the Insert icon in the Controls group and select the Button control.

* Click and drag the cursor on the worksheet to draw the button.

* In the Assign Macro dialog box, type CreateRevenueReport in the Macro name field and click OK. The CreateRevenueReport macro is now assigned to the button.

* Right-click on the button and select Edit Text to change the text on the button (e.g., "Generate Report").

* Click on the worksheet outside of the button to deselect it.

* Now, when you click the button, it will run the CreateRevenueReport macro and generate the report on a new worksheet.

Note: If you want to move the button to a different location on the worksheet, click and drag it to the desired location. You can also resize the button by clicking and dragging its edges or corners.

**Important point**
* The dates in column G of the "Master" worksheet must be in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" for the macro to work correctly.
